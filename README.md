# World Bank - Technical Exercise
World Bank Technical Exercise
This repo contains solutions for a technical challenge by the World Bank. There are 4 files provided here:
1.)	Vaidyanathan_-_Technical_Exercise_-_Part_1.Rmd: 
This is an R Markdown including code that generates the pdf output for Part 1. It has comments on the approach I took.
2.)	Vaidyanathan_-_Technical_Exercise_-_Part_1.r:
This is the non-markdown version of the (1) above, if this is preferred. It generates output to the console.
3.)	Vaidyanathan_-_Technical_Exercise_-_Part_1.pdf:
This is the output pdf generated by (1).
4.)	Vaidyanathan_-_Technical_Exercise_-_Part_2.pdf:
This is a pdf with the answer for Part 2. This file was also created using R markdown. However, as Part 2 did not involve any code, but just required a writeup, only the pdf output was committed to GitHub.
